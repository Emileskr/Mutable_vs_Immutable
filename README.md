# Mutable_vs_Immutable

## This project shows the difference of mutable and immutable classes

Class MutableLucasSequence uses a mathematical formula to compute the next or previous number of the sequence. Fibonacci sequence is one of 
the Lucas sequencies, I used it in my project (other Lucas sequencies can be used too). When creating a new MutableLucasSequence object, the
arguments are constant values a and b (in Fibonacci sequence they are 1 and 0), the previous value of the sequence, and the current value of 
the sequence. Using methods "nextValue" and "previousValue" we get the said results.

The class ImmutableLucasSequence works in the same principle, only these objects ar immutable.
